# Solid Mechanics
This page contains notes for solid continuum mechanics, 
covering the following topics

* [Strains](/Strain)
* [Stresses](/Stress)
* [Elasticity](/Elasticity)
* [The Boundary Value Problem (BVP)](/BoundaryValueProblem).
* [Finite Element Method (FEM)](/FiniteElements)

The tensor notation is introduced on a separate [webpage](https://knutam.github.io/tensors/).
