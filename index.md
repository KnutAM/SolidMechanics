# Solid Mechanics
This page gives a brief introduction to linear solid mechanics covering the following topics

* [Strain](/Strain)
* [Stress](/Stress)
* [Elasticity](/Elasticity)
* [The Boundary Value Problem (BVP)](/BoundaryValueProblem).
* [A very brief introduction to the Finite Element Method (FEM)](/FiniteElements)

The tensor notation is introduced on a separate [webpage](https://knutam.github.io/tensors/).
